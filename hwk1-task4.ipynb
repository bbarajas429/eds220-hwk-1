    "- time = date and time of event (all events from 2014)\n",
    "- latitude = decimal degrees [-90,90]\n",
    "- longitude = decimal degrees [-360,360]\n",
    "- depth = depth of the event (km)\n",
    "- mag =  magnitude of event\n",
    "- id = event identifier\n",
    "- place = where the event took place\n",
    "- type = type of event\n",
